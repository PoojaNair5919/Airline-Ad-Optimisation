# Optimizing Ad Spend for an Airline Using Data Science
This project showcases how I helped an airline company improve their digital ad strategy using a data-driven approach. By analyzing user behavior across mobile and laptop platforms, I identified key audience segments, performed clustering to understand engagement patterns, and built predictive models to target high-propensity users more effectively.

Key steps included:

* Exploratory data analysis across user demographics, travel preferences, and device behavior
* Unsupervised clustering to segment users by engagement levels
* Building and comparing machine learning models (Boosting, Bagging, Stacking, CART)
* Recommending Tuned Boosting models for ad targeting and campaign optimization
* Strategic marketing suggestions including personalization, loyalty programs, and mobile-first focus

Outcome: Actionable insights + robust ML models to maximize ROI, reduce ad waste, and personalize user experience.
